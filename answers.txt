-- What is the Topography Wetness Index? 
The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) is a hydrological model which allows to assess the distribution of areas prone to flash floods.
The TWI is calculated using two parameters: a catchment area and slope, which can both be derived from a DEM.
Slope is an important parameter for the index as it determines flow direction and accumulation of water. 
There are different variations with modifications to the original steady-state TWI, which for instance take soil transmissivity into account or modified how the slope is calculated.

-- How are the TWI values related to the flood probability?
High values indicate a high probability to flash-floods, low values a lower probability.
Thresholds can be set to classify the TWI raster and to determine if an area is flood prone or not.


-- Tool within QGIS Processing Toolbox: 
- Topographic Wetness Index (TIW) by SAGA. This tool requires two input rasters, which have to be obtained from a DEM: one raster with the catchment area and one with slope.
- r.topidx by GRASS
